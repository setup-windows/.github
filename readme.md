# Introduction

Setup Windows is an extensive set of documentation and scripts for setting up
Windows post-install.

I [@oxou](https://github.com/oxou) looked everywhere for a similar set of
scripts but could never find anything reliable, structured, or well documented.

Windows is known to be not that much friendly when it comes to automated
configurations, and if there are ways to control certain configurations and
settings of a particular System app, it probably spans across multiple Registry
paths and cryptic binary data formats that nobody wants to bother with.

Maybe there's a catch somewhere, _maybe_ someone already created a set of
configuration scripts for Windows but I couldn't find any. And maybe that catch
requires third-party tools that cost money and so on - so I'll try and rely
on third-party tools as little as possible.

# Vision

I [@oxou](https://github.com/oxou) will try and document every possible flag
in the Registry of Windows, for each system-based component I can.  
For now I want the scope of the project to be minimal, we don't need to go crazy
here; but we want to get something that's easily configurable and usable.

I'll only strive to target Windows 10 (and maybe Windows 11) because there is
really no point in wasting time on older and unsupported versions of Windows.

Personally I need these scripts developed because I very often work on
installing Windows for other people, and having a script that automates many of
the exhausting tasks would be more than benefitial, not just for me but for
everyone else looking for the same thing.

# Contributions

Contributions are more than welcome. But it would also benefit me
(the maintainer), and everybody else (the contributors) if those contributions
included lots more information than just the script for a particular
configuration.

This also applies if you are contributing to an already made option of a
particular script (or scripts), but if you are just fixing typos then those
don't need extra information as they should be self explanatory (via the title).

# Third parties

This project may also include configurations for applications outside of Windows
(but those who target the Windows Operating System).

For example, configurations may be provided for tools such as Notepad++,
VLC Media Player, etc.

**Please consider contributing to the list, Thanks.**
